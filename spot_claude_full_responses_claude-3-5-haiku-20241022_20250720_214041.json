We answer in the affirmative the surprisingly difficult questions: If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual \\(X\\), then is \\(X\\) a complex Banach space? If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual, does it have a complex predual? We also answer the analogous questions for operator spaces, that is, spaces of operators on a Hilbert space, up to complete isometry. Indeed, we use operator space methods to solve these Banach space questions.\n\nIn 1932 Banach's famous monograph [2] appeared, in which Banach spaces and their dual (or 'conjugate' or 'adjoint') space play a central role. Shortly thereafter F. J. Murray of 'Murray and von Neumann' fame provided the well known \\(\\varphi(x) - i\\varphi(ix)\\) trick (see the second page of [25]) to deal with complex dual spaces \\(X^*\\). It then becomes clear that the real Banach space dual \\(X^\\dagger\\) of a complex Banach space \\(X\\) is itself a complex Banach space. That is, this real Banach space has isometric complex structure. Indeed it is easy to see that  \\(X^\\dagger \\cong X^*\\) real linearly isometrically and weak* homeomorphically (see e.g. [23, Proposition 1.1.6]). However there remain a couple of obvious questions:\n\n**Problem 1.** If \\(Y\\) is a complex Banach space possessing a real predual \\(X\\), then is \\(X\\) (isometrically) a complex Banach space?\n\nThat is, does \\(X\\) have (isometric) complex structure? Rephrasing, Problem 1 asks if \\(X\\) is a real Banach space such that its real Banach space dual \\(X^\\dagger\\) has (isometric) complex structure, then does \\(X\\) have (isometric) complex structure?\n\nIn Problem 1, one would also desire that the sought-for complex structure on \\(X\\) is a complex predual of \\(Y\\), if mercy prevails. Indeed we have:\n\n**Problem 2.** If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual \\(X\\), then does it have a complex predual? Is \\(X\\) a complex predual?\n\nWe note that by 'predual' in Problems 1 and 2 we mean an isometric predual. We will discuss the isomorphic quest\n\nKNOWN ERROR INFORMATION:\n- Error Category: Equation \/ proof\n- Error Location: Lemma 3,4\n- Human Annotation: The issue is that an error in Proposition 2.3 undermines the validity of Lemmas 3 and 4, and Theorem 4.1 depends on results from Proposition 2.3; therefore, Lemmas 3 and 4 are only valid if the conclusions of Proposition 2.3 hold for the map q used in Theorem 4.1.\n\nYour task is to analyze this paper and determine:\n1.

    "prompt":"\nYou are a scientific rigor auditor specializing in academic paper verification. \n\nPAPER CONTENT (truncated):\nWe propose Multi-Antenna (MA) Towards Inband Shift Keying (TISK): a new multi-carrier radio concept to cope with critical link budgets. In contrast to common proposals that rely on analog beamforming at both transmitter and receiver, MA-TISK does not require beam alignment. The transmitted signals have all constant envelope in continuous time, which allows for efficient, low-cost power amplification and up-conversion. The concept is compatible with any linear PSK-modulation as well as pulse position modulation. Each sub-carrier is sent over a separate antenna that is equipped with a voltage-controlled oscillator. The phases of these oscillators are controlled by digital baseband. Temporal signal combining makes up for the lack of beamforming gain at the transmitter. A common message may be broadcast to many receivers, simultaneously. Demodulation can be efficiently implemented by means of fast Fourier transform.\n\nMA-TISK does not suffer from spectral re-growth issues plaguing other constant envelope modulations like GMSK. Almost rectangular signal spectra similar to those for linear modulation with root-raised-cosine pulse shaping are possible.\n\nFor the 100 MHz-wide spectral mask of 5G downlink, QPSK-modulation allows for 160 MBit\/s with 5.74 MHz subcarrier spacing when using 16 transmit antennas. The wide carrier spacing makes the signals insensitive to Doppler effects. There is no loss in link budget gain compared to spatial beamforming at the transmitter.\n\nWireless communication at increasingly high frequencies reduces the effective antenna area due to the smaller wavelengths. As a result, the link budget is reduced even for signal propagation in free space. This effect is often referred to as higher free-space attenuation at higher frequencies.\n\nTo make up for the required link budget, i.e. the required antenna area, the common approach is to stack antenna elements into arrays in order to aggregate the effective antenna areas of the individual antenna elements. \n\nKNOWN ERROR INFORMATION:\n- Error Category: Equation \/ proof\n- Error Location: Unknown\n- Human Annotation: The error is that the beamforming gain for N antennas is incorrectly calculated as N, when it should actually be N^2, since coherent beamforming results in the received power increasing by the square of the number of antennas.\n\nYour task is to analyze this paper and determine:\n1.
